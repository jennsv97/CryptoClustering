# CryptoClustering
In this notebook, I performed K-Means clustering on cryptocurrency data, first using the original scaled data and then applying PCA for dimensionality reduction. I explored different values for k, used Elbow methods to determine the optimal number of clusters, and visualized the clustering results with scatter plots. I faced challenges with distinguishing the clusters in the plots and adjusting the markers and colors for better visualization. Additionally, I encountered issues with missing clusters in the PCA data, which was resolved by reviewing the cluster distribution.
